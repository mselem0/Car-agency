                <p>

                    The EV6 has obtained a first Car of the Year award for Kia. The innovative South Korean SUV has
                    reached the glory in a ceremony held today in Geneva, with 279 points and 12 individual top votes
                    after a close battle with the Renault Mégane E-Tech Electric, second with 265 points, and the
                    Hyundai Ioniq 5, in the third position with 261 points.
                    <br> <br>
                    The Kia brand reinvented itself at the beginning of last year with a new name, logo and distinctive
                    design philosophy named ‘Opposites United’. The EV6 was the very first vehicle launched under this
                    new direction, and also is the first dedicated battery electric Kia vehicle based on its all-new
                    Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP).
                    <br> <br>
                    The EV platform also enables the Kia EV6 pleasant performance, AWD capability and ultra-fast
                    charging times. The vehicle delivers up to an estimated 482 kilometres of all-electric range and
                    vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality. Throughout the cabin, the Kia EV6 shows an unprecedented level
                    of connectivity and safety, advanced driver assistance systems, besides a flat-floor interior with
                    sustainable materials.
                    <br> <br>
                    The heart of the Kia EV6 beats an energy-dense Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese battery pack, available in
                    two sizes (58.0 kWh and 77.4 kWh). This low-mounted and underfloor pack delivers energy to both RWD
                    and AWD electric engine layouts with varying horsepower at the front and rear axles. The EV6 offers
                    from 167 up to 576 horsepower (GT version), this one available throughout this 2022.
                    <br> <br>
                    Excerpts from the jurors:
                    <br> <br>
                    “The EV6 stands out by combining energy efficiency, a large capacity battery and ultra-fast
                    charging”.
                    <br> <br>
                    “Sportier driving, firmer suspension, high range and excellent quick charging, because of 800-volt
                    system, huge space, good package (frunk), nice details in the interior like the double-mode switches
                    for navigation and climate control, no leather trim anymore, V2X-charging possible”.
                    <br> <br>
                    “Inside the roomy and well-finished passenger compartment, the technological innovation is applied
                    to increase the quality of life on board. And once at the wheel, the EV6 offers a smooth and
                    pleasant drive”.
                    <br> <br>
                    “The best electric car of all the finalists. It has the same virtues as the Ioniq 5, but it is an
                    even more balanced car, more refined in the set-up, more attractive in design, with higher quality
                    finishes... And knocking on our emotions we have the 585 hp of the GT developed with Rimac”.
                    <br> <br>
                    “Excellent EV because of its fast charging and good range for the price. In comparison with the
                    Hyundai the EV6 offers less body roll, more playful handling and tighter steering. A bit sportier
                    overall”.
